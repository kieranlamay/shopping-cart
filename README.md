# Shopping Cart

Simple React project simulating a shopping cart application to practice React testing and React router.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Custom template change log:

- removed App.css
- Josh Comeau's CSS Reset
- "react/prop-types": "off" in eslint.config.js

**Notes for this shopping cart project** npm install react-router-dom
